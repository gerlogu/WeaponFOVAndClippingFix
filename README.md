## Documentation

### Basic setup

To carry out the inclusion of this fix, you need to follow these steps:
- Open your arms & weapon parent material.
- Add the following material function: MF_FOV_Clipping_FIX

Now everything is set up! Remember that you need an scalar parameter (usually named
FOV or Field Of View) that will determine the custom weapon FOV. You can update this
parameter during the game execution.

### Weapon Sway
This project also includes a weapon sway system that includes the following sway types:
- Camera movement sway
- Character movement Sway
Both systems are located in two independent components located in the following path:
`Game/WeaponFOVandClippingFix/FOVandClippingFix/Character/Components`

Ensure you have your arms and weapon mesh located inside two different scene components.
